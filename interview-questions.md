# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: AS

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter holds code within it and it seperates parts of a function. An argument is defining seperate pieces of information that are assigned to certain parts of the function, usually defining the various potential outcomes. An argument varies based on what they are commanding the values to produce in a function.

Researched answer: Parameters are determined by the values in a function and they are represented by a pair of parentheses. While arguments in a function are also stores within parentheses and they are used as an add-on to the method used within the function.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: Going off of memory, I'm not sure. I'll need to review my resources to produce the best answer. 

Researched answer: The built in method of ".map()" is a high order function that repeats in an array and outputs an array that mimics the length of the original array. The prefined parameters must be listed in this order: value, index, and array within a ".map high order function". The first parameter - "value" is always required, while the index and array are optional, depending on the desired output of the function. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Going off of memory, I'm not sure. I'll need to review my resources to produce the best answer. 

Researched answer: The difference between the two high order functions of ".map" and ".filter" is that: The filter function looks at each individual element and produces a new list of elements that have been altered by the specific command. While the map function can recieve any array and make the function reusable - but, still looks at each element in the array and outputs an updated array with the same amount of elements. 

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the repitition of the command of a function - so that we don't have to continue typing it. 

Researched answer: Iteration is the act of assigning a command to all elements in an array. Iteration can also be used in loops to perform a repetative command. 

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A method can be used within a function - but, a function cannot be used within a method.

Researched answer: A function always requires a return and it is essentially an individually designed block of code that creates a desired output. While a method is an optional portion of a function that can alter the outcome of an object. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Going off of memory, I'm not sure. I'll need to review my resources to produce the best answer. 

Researched answer: Hoisting in Javascript is the act of changing the organization of the layout of the function to position declarations to the top-most section of the function. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: This lets you obtain an organized presentation of parameters in an array. Spread operator can be used to replace the "concat()" command in a function. 

2. React state: React state is an "object" in Javascript that shares information regarding the component of a function. 

"3. DOM events:
"DOM" stands for document object module. DOM is a visual representation of the markup code - it's job is to make sure that the user experience of the code is pleasant and fast.
